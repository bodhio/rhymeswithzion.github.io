  Getting fans to contribute content to be compilated into a music video is by
  no means a new or particularly creative idea. That being said, this is a
  beautiful compilation of people who share the common interest of enjoying good
  vibes make them a perfect visual back-drop for this groovy sound. Big up to
  everyone situated south of the river.

#### Artist Bio

**Tom Misch** (June 25, 1995), *rose to fame through the release of his original beats and mixes on SoundCloud. After clamor from his fans for an official release, he made his mixtape debut with Beat Tape 1 and then followed with Beat Tape 2.

His interest in music began at the ripe age of five after his parents took him to a few classical concerts and he began to play the violin. By nine, he was playing guitar and by eleven he'd begun creating his own compositions.*
