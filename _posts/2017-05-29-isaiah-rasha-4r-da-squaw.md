  The Sun's Tirade is a critically acclaimed album, so of course the opening
  song and accompanying visuals have to come through with something special.
  This music video does just that with its subtleness and simplistic mellow
  vibes that make it an audivisual masterpiece.

Isaiah Rashad's **The Sun's Tirade** is a great album, and obviously the opening track *4r Da Squaw* (produced by Francis Nguyen-Tran a.k.a FrancisGotHeat) presents this greatness with its chilled out vibe. The accompanying visuals is complimentary to the dopeness of the track, it involves Isaiah and his son cruising about the boardwalk. What makes the video so incredibly pungent is that everyone has a monetary value digitally edited above their head, this simplistic addition (*or subtraction*) reflects a dominant contemporary worldview that everything can be quantified and extracted for our use (including human beings... e.g. 'human resources'or viewing everyone as a monetary value - with a dollar sign above their head - like the video does). The melodic simplicity of the song and accompanying visuals that subtly represent cultural hegemony make this music video truly a brilliant work of art.
