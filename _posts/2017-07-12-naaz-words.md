The video celebrates diversity showing people from different walks of life experiencing each others world. As "video producer" takes us through Amsterdam we're given a taste of how these individuals express themselves to get a glimpse of their world be it fashion, tattoos, dance or something completely different. 

The simplicity of the video perfectly matches the lyrics and complements the underlying message of individualism and inclusion that naaz preaches "I'm in love with your words, will you show me the world through your eyes?"


#### Artist Bio

Naaz is a singer/songwriter/producer from Holland, who immediately captures your attention with her distinctive voice. Having a Kurdish background, it took Naaz quite some time and effort to convince her family to allow her to follow her passion. During that time, Naaz taught herself to write/produce/record her own music, so she could still be able to make music regardless of any circumstances. Now with her family lovingly by her side, she wholeheartedly encourages other artists to do the same and never give up on their dreams.
