#### Contributor's Bio

Adam Yee, is a British-born artist and DJ.  Having first been introduced to the world of music by listening to his late grandfathers Michael Jackson and Madonna vinyls, it was when he moved to London in 2011 that his love affair with electronic music first started.

After what was initially just a casual hobby through meeting a few DJ's at university, he then started to get himself involved on the scene by becoming known for being able to seamlessly mix together a patchwork techno, house, dubstep, and everything in between.  This increasing reputation, as well as a short stint at Vice where he got to work alongside the team at Boiler Room, eventually earned him sets at the more well known clubs in London such as XOYO, Ministry of Sound and Corsica Studios.

Now having entered the professional world of work as a Cheese buyer, Adam has less time to do the rounds on the London circuit but this does not mean you won't still be able to find him DJ'ing and showcasing the various musical selections that he is passionate about.
