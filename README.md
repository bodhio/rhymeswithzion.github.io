That being said, there are free and open source options that meet the needs of this website.
* [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for free web-hosting.
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static-website generator, enables you to build directly from a github repository.
* [Beautiful-Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) template by [Dean Attali](http://deanattali.com) who provides a brilliant [read-me](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll/blob/master/README.md) which guides you how to set-up your own website just like this one.  
* [Prose.io](http://prose.io) Content management system that provides a user-friendly interface for writing in markdown. This read-me document, as well as all the other pages and posts on the website were written and published through github using [prose.io](http://prose.io).

Little bio and relevant links for author /curator / person who submitted content being shared
```

It should be easy to write-up a post based on that example. The sample writing needs to be replaced with your content. The links need to be changed to relevant URLs. The majority of videos are from youtube, so the example is for embedding youtube videos. You would do this by replacing the two '#YoutubeID' written in the example with the relevant Youtube video ID, if you don't know how to find it then <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+find+youtube+video+id" target="_blank">this may help you</a>. It is possible to do this with other video streaming platforms like vimeo, just get the video link and then please <a href="http://embedresponsively.com/" target="_blank">embed responsively</a>.
