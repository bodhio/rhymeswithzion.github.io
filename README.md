## Introduction

There are plenty of platforms to build a website with user-friendly and intuitive interfaces that enable people with little to no coding skills. Many of these platforms have costs for hosting, templates, and content management systems that can add up to become quite expensive for running a website. Although there are completely free platforms, they usually have limitation when in comes to design and features.

That being said, there are free and open source options that meet the needs of this website.
* [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for free web-hosting.
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static-website generator, enables you to build directly from a github repository.
* [Beautiful-Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) template by [Dean Attali](http://deanattali.com) who provides a brilliant [read-me](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll/blob/master/README.md) which guides you how to set-up your own website just like this one.  
* [Prose.io](http://prose.io) Content management system that provides a user-friendly interface for writing in markdown. This read-me document, as well as all the other pages and posts on the website were written and published through github using [prose.io](http://prose.io).

Rhymes with Zion is built, designed, and managed completely on a web-browser (even the and the only money spent was on the domain name (which is unavoidable but purchased for an affordable price through [NameCheap](http://namecheap.com/))

### Purpose

Rhymes with zion provides a digital place for the curation of audio-visual works of art. It is a collaborative project which aims to post one work of art each day for 2017.

### Who is it for?

This website remains as inclusive as possible and tries it's best to be accessible to anyone with access to the internet. Whether you are a passive viewer exploring the web looking for cool and interesting content to surf through, or actively engaged wanting to [get involved](#get-involved)

### What Rhymes with Zion isn't

Rhymes with Zion is unfortunately not the place to find out what rhymes with zion. Luckily, there are <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u7PoI3MD21fb0GxSsZyfxVKJhmEE8eP3cbyBOWyufss" target="_blank">plenty of websites</a> which provide that service. It also, is not on the front-page of googl3 (as you may have seen if you clicked that link above)... yet. 

Rhymes with Zion is not a website for self-promotion. Although it encourages contribution through the [curation](#curate) and [individual submissions](#submissions) of their favourite audio-visual works of art, it is not a place for artists to share their own work. By sharing the work of others, you can indirectly promote yourself through your [contributor's page](http://www.rwz.io/contributors/test). If you would like to see your audio-visual work of art posted on the site, please get someone else to submit it on your behalf. 


Rhymes with Zion is not commercially driven in any way. It does not have a profit motive, and therefore it is not a place where you will see any form of advertisement or marketing campaigns. There is no space for sponsored content or promotional posts. Every work of art being showcased is shared for the sake of itself, presenting it as intrinsically valueable and not just a means to an end.

Little bio and relevant links for author /curator / person who submitted content being shared
```

It should be easy to write-up a post based on that example. The sample writing needs to be replaced with your content. The links need to be changed to relevant URLs. The majority of videos are from youtube, so the example is for embedding youtube videos. You would do this by replacing the two '#YoutubeID' written in the example with the relevant Youtube video ID, if you don't know how to find it then <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+find+youtube+video+id" target="_blank">this may help you</a>. It is possible to do this with other video streaming platforms like vimeo, just get the video link and then please <a href="http://embedresponsively.com/" target="_blank">embed responsively</a>.
