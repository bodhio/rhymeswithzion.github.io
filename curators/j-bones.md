Toronto native currently roaming Van City and relishing the Pacific Northwest life. Devotee to all things Hip-hop, Jazz, Funk, R&B/Soul and Indie/Alt. Rock. When i’m not delving into new avenues of music, chances are you’ll find me outdoors hiking, skating, snowboarding or lounging with a good read. I have an academic background in The Humanities and Social Sciences and am an advocate of human empathy and breaking the status quo. I’ve always pursued the saying “consider your sources” regardless of the medium and I believe music and music journalism are no exceptions. 

#### Influences

Grew up mainly as a 90’s hip-hop head, some major influences include Gang Starr, Pete Rock, A Tribe Called Quest, The Pharcyde, J Dilla, MF DOOM, Madlib, Lord Finesse along with the rest of the D.I.T.C. crew just to name a few.. 

Also a lover of 60’s and 70’s jazz, blues, funk/soul and R&B (i.e. the music that blossomed hip-hop). Some favourite artists from this era include Parliament/Funkadelic, Stevie Wonder, Quincy Jones, Steely Dan, Kool & The Gang, and Roy Ayers.

Some other genres that have definitely helped shape my musical taste include Low-Fi, Alternative R&B, 80’s New Wave & Synth-Pop, Grunge, and Psych-Rock. All of these disparate forms of music have morphed into a personal pastiche that guides me as a listener, appreciator and curator.
