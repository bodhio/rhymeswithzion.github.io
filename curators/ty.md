I was born in the year of "Hey lover", "Straight outta Compton" and  "Dirty Diana", the great 1988, and raised to the soundtrack of soul music with a whiff of eighties pop and classic rock.

Even though I listen to a range of genres, hip hop has long been my true love. 

A few years of rapping taught me that the stage is nice, but the studio is life. So I left the rap scene for songwriting and a job curating music for Getmixed radio, which eventually led me to host a show at the same station. 

At the moment you're most likely to spot me dancing salsa at a Latin party somewhere in the Netherlands.
