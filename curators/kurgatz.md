I am a professional musician, from Toronto, Ontario, Canada, but currently residing in beautiful British Columbia, using the mountains as my inspiration. The outdoors and the beautiful mountains here on the Pacific North West are not only a source of inspiration for my music, but a breath of fresh air, which keeps me sharp. I also have a passion for entrepreneurship, marketing and people, I think we all need to work together to make the world an inspiring  beautiful and challenging place.  

You will probably find me playing guitar or bass, skiing, hiking, travelling or dancing my ass off at a music festival. 

#### Influences

Growing up studying music and idolizing bands, The Beatles will always be on the forefront of any music that I listen to and a relative point. The craft of songwriting and arranging will never be a lost art form. Since bass is my primary instrument, I'm a sucker for deep grooves, soulful horn lines, backbeats and funky beats. I'm always interested in discovering new music, that breaks boundaries and creates something exciting. You can expect the unexpected with me.
