I am a Toronto native based in London who is passionate about technology and art. I decided to create rwz.io as a collaborative project which bridges the gap between art and technology by providing a digital space for the curation of audio-visual works of art. My day job involves working for the government to help improve the lives of citizens through delivering transformational digital services, and in my free time I enjoy going to concerts / galleries / markets / museums / exploring the city and discovering new things. 

You will probably find me trying to get others involved with rhymeswithzion, as I am always looking for collaborators and interesting people to curate. If you are interested in getting involved, [learn more here](https://rwz.io/get-involved/) and do not hesitate to [get in touch](https://rwz.io/contact/).

#### Influences

As a lover of philosophy, I believe there are no new ideas under the sun. This brings my affinity to hip-hop, since I love the iterative approach it takes by creating new sounds from old samples. I am a huge fan of animation and live of the floor performance. So when it is curated by me, expect lots of hip-hop / animation / and live performances. 

Also, as a Canadian living in the UK I have an unconscious bias to predominantly share artists that are based in either of these two places (not to mention there is some great stuff being produced from these two creative hubs) but I am open to all works of art from around the world and open to all genres / styles. I hope you enjoy the audio-visual works of art curated by me, and please do [provide feedback](https://rwz.io/feedback/).
